## Usage
If you disable the 1st cougar territory in a region, then ALL cougar territories will be disabled for that region.  
If you disable the 2nd cougar territory in a region, then the 3rd cougar territory will also be disabled for that region.  
If you disable the 3rd cougar territory for a region, then only the 3rd cougar territory will be disabled.

If you disable any territories while you are actively in a region, the cougars will immediately dissapear and will be disabled.
If you have previously disabled any of the cougar territories and re-enable ny territories, you will need to reload the game for change to take effect.
