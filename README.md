## Usage
If you disable the 1st cougar territory in a region, then ALL cougar territories will be disabled for that region.  
If you disable the 2nd cougar territory in a region, then the 3rd cougar territory will also be disabled for that region.  
If you disable the 3rd cougar territory for a region, then only the 3rd cougar territory will be disabled.

You should enable settings and then load/start your game to ensure everything works properly.
If you have previously disabled any of the cougar territories and re-enable any territories, you will need to reload the game for change to take effect.
